# What I Hope to Learn in INFO 201

I hope to become more fluent in R and understand how to *visualize and organize data*. I hope that by the end of the class, I will have enough skills to be able to understand youtube videos and other resources so that I may be able to ***help myself learn on my own time*** as well. Finally, I hope to make a really great project that I can put on my **resume**. 

- coding framework
- independence
- resume building
